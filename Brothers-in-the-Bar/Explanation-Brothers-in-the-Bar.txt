1. The program will read the input, then will try to split the string and create a list of integers. If it cannot be parsed to a list it will throw a message and let you type the input again untill it's in the write format.

2. The program will start iterating through the list of glasses. There is a list of consecutiveDrinks that will be our counter of current consecutive drinks in the list.

3. After the iterating begins through the list there are 2 conditions, if the list of "consecutiveDrinks" is empty and when it have item/s. If it's empty we add the first item from "glasses" list to the "consecutiveDrinks" list. If it's not empty it checks if the current item in "glasses" is equal to the first item in "consecutiveDrinks" list, if it's not equal "consecutiveDrink" list is cleared and then add the current "glasses" item in our empty "consecutiveDrinks" list. If it's equal, add the new item from the "glasses" list to the "consecutiveDrinks" list. Then if the "consecutiveDrinks" list count gets to 3 items, clear the "consecutiveDrinks" list, then remove the glasses that are consecutive in "glasses" list, incrementing the "countOfDrinkingRounds" and refreshing index of the loop to -1, restarting the loop. This proccess will continue untill it no longer satisfies the condition.

4. At the end program prints the count of consecutive drinks that have been found.
